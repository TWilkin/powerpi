# PowerPi

Home automation microservice stack communicating via MQTT (using [mosquitto](https://mosquitto.org/)) built with Typescript, Python, Go and [NodeMCU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NodeMCU) C deployable with [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) on a [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.com/) cluster.

This project was devised to utilise open, reverse engineered or free home automation hardware and software together without the need for third-party hubs, cloud services or subscriptions wherever possible.

### Supported IoT Hardware

- [Amazon Alexa](https://developer.amazon.com/en-GB/alexa/devices)
- [Energenie MiHome](https://energenie4u.co.uk/catalogue/category/Raspberry-Pi-Accessories)
- [LIFX](https://www.lifx.com/)
- [Logitech Harmony](https://www.logitech.com/en-gb/products/harmony.html)
- [NodeMCU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NodeMCU)
- [ZigBee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zigbee)

### Supported Services

- [N3rgy](http://www.n3rgy.com/)
- [Snapcast](https://github.com/badaix/snapcast)

## Getting Started

The project is split into the following services, each of which have their own _README_ describing the configuration interface they support as well as how to modify and test them.

- [**api**](services/api/README.md) - API
- [**config-server**](services/config-server/README.md) - Retrieve configuration files from GitHub.
- **controllers**:
    - [**energenie**](controllers/energenie/README.md) - Allows control of [Energenie MiHome](https://energenie4u.co.uk/catalogue/category/Raspberry-Pi-Accessories) devices using the ENER314 or ENER314-RT Pi module.
    - [**harmony**](controllers/harmony/README.md) - Allows control of [Logitech Harmony](https://www.logitech.com/en-gb/products/harmony.html) Smart Hub devices.
    - [**lifx**](controllers/lifx/README.md) - Allows control of [LIFX](https://www.lifx.com/) light devices.
    - [**network**](controllers/network/README.md) - Allows control of LAN (Local Area Network) devices.
    - [**snapcast**](controllers/snapcast/README.md) - Allows control of [Snapcast](https://github.com/badaix/snapcast) clients and servers.
    - [**virtual**](controllers/virtual/README.md) - Allows control of other devices by using virtual devices such as groups, delays, mutexes etc.
    - [**zigbee**](controllers/zigbee/README.md) - Allows control of [ZigBee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zigbee) devices and sensors.
- [**energy-monitor**](services/energy-monitor/README.md) - Retrieve electricity and gas consumption in 30-minute blocks from UK smart meter submissions via [N3rgy](http://www.n3rgy.com/).
- [**event**](services/event/README.md) - Allows custom actions to be taken when events appear in the message queue.
- [**persistence**](services/persistence/README.md) - Service for writing all the messages that appear in the MQTT message queue to a database.
- [**scheduler**](services/scheduler/README.md) - Schedule based control of light devices, e.g. brightness, colour, temperature etc.
- [**ui**](services/ui/README.md) - NGINX hosting the UI.
- [**voice-assistant**](services/voice-assistant/README.md) - Integration with Amazon Alexa skill to receive voice commands.

The project includes a [_shutdown_](services/shutdown/README.md) service which allows a computer to be remotely shutdown by message queue events generated by PowerPi.

The project also includes sensor NodeMCU code in the [_sensors_](sensors/README.md) directory which can be used to generate events when motion is detected, or temperature/humidity readings at an interval.

## Building

The latest image for each service can be found on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/twilkin), if you've made local changes (or want to try out a service locally) you can build it from scratch with the following instructions.

The images can be built with Docker's [_buildx_](https://docs.docker.com/buildx/working-with-buildx/) tool which supports cross-compilation of images, allowing us to build ARM images for deployment on a Raspberry Pi on an x86_64 architecture. Although, if you're not using Energenie and therefore don't need the Pi module you can build and run the stack on other architectures supported by the base images.

```bash
# From the root of your checkout of PowerPi
# Build an image with buildx, the image version tags can be found in the service's package.json or pyproject.toml file.
docker buildx build --platform linux/arm/v7 --push -t MY_DOCKER_REGISTRY/powerpi-config-server:1.0.0 -f services/config-server/Dockerfile .

# Or for 64-bit ARM
docker buildx build --platform linux/arm64 --push -t MY_DOCKER_REGISTRY/powerpi-config-server:1.0.0 -f services/config-server/Dockerfile .

# Or x86-64
docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64 --push -t MY_DOCKER_REGISTRY/powerpi-config-server:1.0.0 -f services/config-server/Dockerfile .
```

## Deployment

Deploying the services is simply a matter of deploying the stack using Kubernetes, which will pull the latest images from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/twilkin).

The instructions for deploying the stack using Kubernetes can be found as follows:

- [Kubernetes](kubernetes/README.md)
