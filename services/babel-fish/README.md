# PowerPi - Babel Fish

PowerPi service which provides [Amazon Alexa](https://developer.amazon.com/en-GB/alexa/devices) voice support to PowerPi. Amazon can access this service via the NGINX service's reverse proxy when a port forwarding rule is applied on the router, as well as an SSL certificate generated by the _certbot_ service.

The service is built using typescript, with dependencies using yarn workspaces. It is also dependant on a local common library [_@powerpi/common_](../common/node/common/README.md) and a common API library [_@powerpi/api_](../common/node/api/README.md), both of which need to be compiled before use.

An example voice command to turn the device "BedroomLight" on would be:

`alexa ask power pi to turn my bedroom light on`

## Building

The Docker container can be built utilising _buildx_ as described in the [project documentation](../README.md#Building).

## Configuration

### Environment

This service expects the following environment variables to be set before it will start successfully. When using docker these are already configured in the _docker-compose_ file, however when running locally for testing we need to define these:

-   **JOVO_PORT** - The port the service runs on (default _3000_).

## Testing

There are currently no automated tests for this service.

## Local Execution

The service can be started locally with the following commands.

```bash
# From the root of your PowerPi checkout
# Download the dependencies
yarn

# Build the api and common library
yarn build:api
yarn build:common

# Run the service locally
yarn start:babel-fish
```
